As this is private land Peterborough City Council are unable to resolve, this is the land owner’s responsibility. Your report will still be sent to Peterborough City Council’s environmental enforcement team who will investigate. Unfortunately, they can’t provide updates on these investigations so your report will be marked as closed once it has been received.
